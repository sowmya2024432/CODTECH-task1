Overview of the project OBJECTIVE The objective of a simple calculator program in Python is to provide a basic tool for performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

KEYACTIVITIES: User Interaction: Allow users to input numbers and select operations through a simple text-based interface. Basic Arithmetic Operations: Implement core functions to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Error Handling: Handle potential errors, such as division by zero or invalid input, gracefully. Output Results: Display the result of the selected operation to the user. Flexibility: Provide a way to perform multiple calculations in a session, often through a loop or menu system. OUTPUT: Welcome to the basic calculator! Enter the first number: 1 Enter the second number: 1 Select operation: 1.Addition 2. Subtraction 3. Multiplication 4. Division Enter the number of the operation you want to perform (1/2/3/4): 1 Result: 1.0 + 4.0 = 5.0
